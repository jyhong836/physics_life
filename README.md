============

a new Life System, including two layer, Physics Layer and Neural Layer

 In this Project, I tend to build a new Life System, including two layer.
    The first layer is the physics layer, and the second is neural layer. In the physics layer, I wanna apply the HPP model for the particle system. The cell life will be based on the particles collision and  moving. And the neural layer, will process the message from the other layer. The message include the collision, the capture of special message particle, etc.
     I'm just begin the project this term. A github depository has been created in https://github.com/jyhong836/physics_life
     
 Update
 ======
 This repsository may not update recent days, I have create a new repository in [CellularAutomata3D](https://github.com/jyhong836/CellularAutomata3D). They are actually go for the same destination. But I think I may try in another way to do the thing.
